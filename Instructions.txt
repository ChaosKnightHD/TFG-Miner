Note:
To use this program properly in TFG you already need a quantum gate setup into AE2 (IV minimum) and already have your large miner built.
You can use energy p2p to supply the amperage and exporting the drilling fluid below, directly through the quantum gate. Or you can just batbuff + supertank onsite, your choice.
If you want to have fun moving other 5x8x5 machines around on the go (a quad boiler lol) give it a try!

Make sure you have these items in your turtle:
- 10 Smart Dense cable 
- 16^3 spatial storage cell (your miner must already be is inside it)
- Spatial IO port
- Entangled Singularity
- 8 quantum Ring Blocks
- Quantum Chamber
- 30 spatial pylons
- A pickaxe on turtle's left side (probably red steel best)
- Wireless modem on turtle's right side

And a pocket computer if you want remote access:
Have a wireless modem on your pocket computer (type lua then type pocket.equipBack() on the interpreter). You can always just execute startMiner and packMiner directly inside the turtle.


Installing the program(s) to your minecraft computers:
1. Enter your world and make a turtle and pocket computer, its ID is displayed on tooltip
2. Go to TerrafirmaGreg/saves/world/computercraft/computer
3. For the Pocket Computer paste 'protocol'
4. For the Turtle, paste the rest of the programs inside


Alternatively you can use pastebin if you are playing on a server. Install the programs one by one and type these strings each (e.g pastebin get q1FzctMF deconstrutor).
Make sure the program names are EXACTLY the same as the downloads or it won't work.

Turtle:
kuW7Bn9Z - startup 
knshD1K1 - startMiner 
aPCK2HQQ - packMiner 
q1FzctMF - deconstructer 

Pocket Computer:
Gbanrsp2 - protocol 


Operating it:
- Type the protocol program in your pocket computer to receive the prompt
- DO NOT let the turtle dig under collapsable dirt/stone, TFC debris breaks the turtle if it falls on top
- Have the turtle chunk loaded at all times or it will freeze, just like the miner would gathering ore
- If its snowing, the turtle may miss the cable placement if the snow pile grows just after the turtle clears the ground below. Have it build floating above ground as a guarantee. (Another TFC mechanic, not in Vanilla Java)
